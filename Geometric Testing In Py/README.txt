Hello and welcome to my Geometry Calculator.  If you're looking at this and are not from the class I'm making this for, 
feel free to look around but know that this is a minimalist project to get something somewhat presentable for an assingment.

Running the webapp:
1.0 > download all the files to your computer.

2.0 > If you dont want the extra python libraries in your default python folder create a python virtual environment
2.1 > Navigate to the directory you put all the files.
2.3 > Make the new environment by typing python -m venv newEnvName
2.4 > Start the environment by typing newEnvName/Scripts/activate.bat on windows or "source newEnvName/Scripts/activate" on mac
2.5 > If you're on windows and you're getting errors activating the venv, make sure you're using the command prompt instead of the powershell since there may be permissions blocking scripts from running.

3.0 > make sure all required libraries are installed by typing "pip install -r requrements.txt"

4.0 > run webapp.py
